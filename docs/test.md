# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

Today I started my research on PINNs for my graduation project.

## Key Concept
PINNs integrate physical laws (expressed as PDEs) into the deep learning framework.

## Loss Function
The total loss is:
$$Loss = L_{data} + L_{PDE}$$

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up the neural network architecture.
2. Define the partial differential equations.
3. Train the model using Adam optimizer.
